**Tips:**

- Copy the above text from this chat (select all, right-click Copy).
- Paste it into a plain text editor like Notepad, VS Code, or directly into your GitHub repository’s README.md file in GitHub’s web editor.
- Don’t copy from a rendered page that adds UI elements like "Copy" buttons or language tags — those are not part of markdown.

If you want, I can prepare a downloadable `README.md` file for you so you can just upload
